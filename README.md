 - 🔟 Top Vendors: Diageo North America, Martignetti Co, etc.
 - 📉 Lowest Performing Vendors: Based on profit contribution
 - 🧪 Low Performing Brands: Sales vs. Margin scatter plot
 - 💡 Insights:
       -- 65% of total purchases are concentrated with 10 vendors
       -- Some vendors maintain high profit margins but low sales
       -- Bulk purchases reduce unit cost by ~72%

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
 - 📈 High-margin, low-volume brands could benefit from promotion
 - ⚠️ Over-reliance on a few vendors introduces supply risk
 - 🛑 $2.71M in unsold inventory due to low turnover
 - 💸 Bulk purchases reduce unit costs significantly
